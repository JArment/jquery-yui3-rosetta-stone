In late 2009 I was porting a largish prototype from [jQuery][jquery] to [YUI3][yui3] and kept 
wishing for a cheatsheet to help me translate the idioms of one library to the other. 

You can read and comment on the [HTML version][html], [download the PDF][pdf], or fork the 
[project on GitHub][gh]. It is by no means complete or authoritative but I hope it's useful.
 
This is a reference, not an evaluation or comparison of the libraries. If you have an opinion 
about which one is "better", that's great, but I don't want to hear it.

Enjoy!
